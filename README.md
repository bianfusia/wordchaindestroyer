# Word Chain Destroyer

<img src="https://github.com/bianfusia/wordchaindestroyer/blob/main/ss/Untitled.png" width="400" height="300">

## Background

I was annoyed by the fact that people in the on9 word chain channel are unusually strong. It is as though they had help from extra terrestrial lifeform!
So I have developed this helper bot to defeat people in the channel!

## Caveat

Based on my research the bot only accept words from:
- Dictionary json found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_dictionary.json).
- Bot owner adding words directly to the bot

This bot only covers the dictionary json part of the word but it is enough to destroy players.

## Installation
### The python way
Just run ```main.py``` on your IDE or compiler.

### The no python way
1. Download ```build.zip```.
2. Extract ```build.zip```.
3. go into the build folder and run ```main.exe```.

### The "I want to make my own exe" way
1. Open ```cmd``` and ```cd``` to the folder
2. Run ```python setup.py build```
